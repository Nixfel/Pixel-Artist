# Pixel-Artist
The pixel art mod is a mod that aims to make creating pixel art in Terraria easier while adding fun content like pets. All of the mod's items can be bought from an NPC, the Pixel Artist. The Pixel Artist moves in after you defeat the Eater of Worlds or the Brain of Cthulhu. 
They sell: 
- 20 colors of pixel blocks used for making pixel art 
- 3 new pets, 2 are always available and 1 is only sold during the Blood Moon 
- A new weapon 
- A new music box
- More!
Most of the items (besides pixel blocks) the NPC sells are themed around games with pixel art graphics.  I hope you enjoy this mod as much as I did creating it, if you would like to learn more about this mods content please go to this mod's homepage. Thanks for checking it out!
